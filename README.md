# KSS Security Writeup

This is a web based CTF i found in a discord-server i recently joined. 

The CTF is hosted over at https://killswitchsecurity.cf 

It contains very much crypto-stuff but on a easy level, perfect for me.

This CTF was solved on Windows and using alsmost only web-based encode/decoders
